In order to run, run the bat file or open a command line terminal in this
directory and type in:

java pkg180a2j.Main

It should work if Java is installed in your path and you have JRE.

To play, you must type in the command into the command prompt; the buttons
are only used to display the text in a larger format.

For example, If you were going first and you want to move the knights,
you must type in:

d2c4

Other comments:

- You only have chances moves to make a move, unless you capture another piece
- You must take the king to win 
- Minimax algorithm can be CPU intensive, so it might take a couple of seconds
	of CPU processing to calculate the move. However, the program is tested only
	to 4 plies, so it should not take too long.
